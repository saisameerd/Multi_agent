# ü§ñ No-Match Analysis Guide
## Enhanced NL2SQL Agent with Dialogflow CX Optimization

---

## üìã Overview

The enhanced nl2sql agent now includes a powerful **No-Match Analysis Flow** that helps Dialogflow CX developers optimize their chatbots by:

1. **Analyzing no_match events** in conversation data
2. **Identifying patterns** that lead to intent failures
3. **Providing bot-specific recommendations** for improvement
4. **Generating downloadable CSV files** with training phrases for Dialogflow CX import

---

## üéØ How It Works

### 1. Intent Detection
The agent automatically detects when you want no-match analysis based on keywords like:
- "no_match", "no match"
- "intent failures", "bot improvement"
- "suggestions", "recommendations"
- "csv", "training phrases"

### 2. Data Retrieval
Retrieves conversation data from BigQuery with focus on:
- Conversations with no_match events
- User utterances that led to no_match
- Intent detection confidence scores
- Conversation context and flow

### 3. Pattern Analysis
Analyzes the data to identify:
- Common no_match patterns
- Root causes of intent failures
- Missing intent coverage
- Training phrase gaps

### 4. Bot Structure Analysis (Optional)
If you provide your Dialogflow CX bot JSON, the agent will:
- Analyze your current intent structure
- Extract existing training phrases
- Identify optimization opportunities
- Suggest improvements based on your bot's specific setup

### 5. CSV Generation
Creates downloadable CSV files containing:
- New intent suggestions with training phrases
- Enhanced training phrases for existing intents
- Priority rankings for implementation
- Detailed descriptions and categories

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic No-Match Analysis
```
User: "Analyze no_match events from last week"

Agent Response:
- Retrieves conversation data with no_match events
- Analyzes patterns and provides recommendations
- Shows summary of findings and suggested improvements
```

### With Bot JSON Analysis
```
User: "Analyze no_match events and provide bot-specific recommendations"

Agent Response:
- Analyzes your Dialogflow CX bot structure
- Compares no_match patterns with existing intents
- Provides specific recommendations for your bot
- Suggests new intents and training phrases
```

### CSV Generation
```
User: "Generate CSV with training phrases for Dialogflow CX import"

Agent Response:
- Creates downloadable CSV file with training phrases
- Includes new intents and enhanced existing intents
- Prioritizes recommendations by impact
- Provides ready-to-import format for Dialogflow CX
```

## üìä CSV Format

The generated CSV files contain the following columns:

| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Intent Name | Name of the intent | `AccountSuspensionIntent` |
| Training Phrase | The training phrase text | `"Why is my account suspended?"` |
| Priority | Implementation priority | `High/Medium/Low` |
| Category | Type of improvement | `New Intent/Existing Intent Enhancement` |
| Description | Purpose of the intent | `"Handles account suspension queries"` |

### Example CSV Content:
```csv
Intent Name,Training Phrase,Priority,Category,Description
AccountSuspensionIntent,Why is my account suspended?,High,New Intent,Handles account suspension queries
AccountSuspensionIntent,My account got suspended,High,New Intent,Handles account suspension queries
PaymentIssueIntent,I can't make a payment,Medium,New Intent,Handles payment-related issues
PaymentIssueIntent,Payment is not working,Medium,New Intent,Handles payment-related issues
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### BigQuery Schema
The agent works with the following BigQuery table structure:
```sql
`gup-gpi-routing.gpi_routing.dialogflow_bigquery_export_data`
```

Key fields used:
- `conversation_name`: Conversation identifier
- `request`: JSON containing user input and intent detection
- `request_time`: Timestamp for date filtering
- `intentDetectionConfidence`: Confidence score for intent matching

### No-Match Detection Query
```sql
SELECT
   REGEXP_EXTRACT(conversation_name, r'[^\\/]+$') AS Convo_ID,
   STRING_AGG(JSON_VALUE(request, '$.queryInput.text.text'), '\\n---\\n' ORDER BY request_time) AS conversation_script,
   COUNT(CASE WHEN JSON_VALUE(request, '$.intentDetectionConfidence') = '0.0' OR JSON_VALUE(request, '$.intentDetectionConfidence') IS NULL THEN 1 END) as no_match_count
FROM
   `gup-gpi-routing.gpi_routing.dialogflow_bigquery_export_data`
WHERE
   DATE(request_time) BETWEEN 'YYYY-MM-DD' AND 'YYYY-MM-DD'
   AND JSON_VALUE(request, '$.queryInput.text.text') IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
   Convo_ID
HAVING
   no_match_count > 0
ORDER BY
   no_match_count DESC
LIMIT 10
```

### Dialogflow CX JSON Structure
Based on the [Google Cloud Dialogflow CX documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/reference/json-export), the agent analyzes:

- **agent.json**: Bot configuration and metadata
- **intents/**: Intent definitions and training phrases
- **flows/**: Flow structure and pages
- **pages/**: Page configurations and transitions

## üéØ Best Practices

### 1. Regular Analysis
- Run no-match analysis weekly to identify trends
- Focus on high-frequency no_match patterns
- Prioritize improvements based on impact

### 2. CSV Implementation
- Review generated CSV files before import
- Test new intents in development environment
- Monitor performance after implementation

### 3. Bot Optimization
- Provide your bot JSON for more specific recommendations
- Consider intent hierarchy and flow structure
- Balance between intent specificity and coverage

### 4. Training Phrase Quality
- Ensure training phrases are diverse and representative
- Include variations of user language and intent
- Consider context and conversation flow

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **No Data Retrieved**
   - Check date range in your query
   - Verify BigQuery table access
   - Ensure conversation data exists for the specified period

2. **CSV Not Generated**
   - Include "csv" keyword in your query
   - Ensure no-match analysis completed successfully
   - Check artifact permissions in Google ADK

3. **Bot JSON Analysis Fails**
   - Verify JSON format matches Dialogflow CX export
   - Ensure all required files are present
   - Check for malformed JSON syntax

### Support:
- Check the main README for setup instructions
- Verify environment variables are configured
- Ensure all dependencies are installed
